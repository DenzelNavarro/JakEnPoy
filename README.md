This project is a simple, yet fun Jak En Poy game (Filipino version of Rock, Paper, Scissors) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a nostalgic retro dark theme inspired by arcade classics, with neon-styled elements and playful animations. The goal is to reach a score of 3 first, and the twist: if you win, the computer becomes the monkey, but if you lose, youâ€™re the monkey!

Key Features:

Retro Dark Theme: Neon colors and pixelated fonts give the game an old-school arcade look.
Dynamic Scoring System: Race to 3 points to win.

Fun Twist: Computer or player becomes the "monkey" based on the game outcome.
Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Interactive UI: Buttons react with smooth hover and active state animations.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for styling with retro neon effects
JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
